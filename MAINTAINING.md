# Maintaining the Carve ecosystem

Three repositories move in lockstep:

| Repo | Role |
|------|------|
| [`carve`](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve) | Specification. `resources/grammar.ebnf` is **normative**; `docs/examples.md` generates the `tests/corpus/*.crv` + `*.html` pairs that are the **cross-impl conformance contract**. |
| [`carve-js`](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-js) | Reference implementation (TypeScript). Its compiled output is vendored into `carve` to render the docs and validate the corpus. |
| [`carve-php`](https://github.com/markup-carve/carve-php) | PHP implementation. Conforms to the same corpus. |

## The lockstep

`carve` vendors a **compiled copy of carve-js** at `docs/.vitepress/carve-lib/`.
`scripts/sync-carve-lib.mjs` is the **single source for re-vendoring**: it builds
`../carve-js` (a hardcoded sibling checkout) and copies its `dist/`. The corpus is
generated separately by `scripts/generate-corpus.mjs`, which extracts the
` ```carve ` / ` ```html ` pairs from `docs/examples.md` **verbatim**; CI then
verifies those pairs against the vendored carve-lib (`npm run corpus:build` +
`git diff --exit-code` + `npm test`).

Each implementation carries a git submodule pointing back at `carve`
(`spec` in carve-js, `tests/spec` in carve-php). Keeping those current is
automated by the `Bump spec corpus` workflow (`.github/workflows/bump-spec.yml`)
in each impl repo — weekly + manual dispatch, idempotent on a single
`automation/bump-spec` branch.

### Order for a cross-cutting behavior change

1. **carve-js first.** Land the behavior in the reference impl with unit tests.
   Merge to `main`.
2. **carve next.** Add the `docs/examples.md` pair(s), then
   `npm run sync-carve-lib` (re-vendor from the *merged* carve-js main),
   `npm run corpus:build`, and `npm test`. Commit the examples, the regenerated
   corpus, and the re-vendored carve-lib together.
3. **carve-php (and any other impl).** Bump `tests/spec` to the new carve main
   (the automation does this), make the impl match the new pairs, and promote any
   newly passing categories in `tests/CarveCorpusTest.php`.

### Coordination rules (avoid duplicate / reverting PRs)

- **Check `gh pr list` in all three repos before opening a PR.** Parallel
  automation has produced duplicate PRs (e.g. two identical submodule bumps);
  reuse or close the existing one rather than stacking another.
- **One dedicated branch per task.** The bump automation deliberately reuses a
  single `automation/bump-spec` branch so re-runs update one PR.
- **Never re-vendor carve-lib from a carve-js that lags `main`.** Re-vendoring
  reverts impl changes that were merged after the vendored snapshot. Always
  re-vendor from merged carve-js `main`, and confirm the vendored diff contains
  *only* the intended change before committing.

## Known cross-impl divergences

### Resolved (now pinned in the corpus)

These were verified carve-js ↔ carve-php differences; both impls now agree and
the behavior is pinned in `docs/examples.md`:

| Input | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
| `[x]{title="a\"b"}` — escaped quote in a quoted value | A backslash escapes ASCII punctuation in a quoted value (grammar `quoted_value` + `escaped_char`); value is `a"b`. carve-js gained escape support to match carve-php. *(64-attribute-edge-cases)* |
| `# H {???}` — heading attr block with no valid attribute | Grammar `attribute_list` needs ≥ 1 attribute, so the block is heading text. carve-js stopped dropping it. *(64-attribute-edge-cases)* |
| `text\n[^f]: note` — footnote defined but never referenced | No endnotes section is emitted. carve-php stopped leaking an empty `<ol>`. *(43-footnotes)* |
| Mention URL template | Canonical placeholder `{name}` for mentions and tags, value URL-encoded. carve-js accepts `{name}` (with `{user}` as a legacy alias); carve-php encodes the value. Config-only, so not corpus-testable. |
| `[x]{}` — bracket + empty attribute block | A valid attribute block forms a span even when empty; both emit `<span>x</span>` (carve-js now materializes the empty span, matching carve-php/djot). *(66-inline-span)* |
| `[x]{ }` / `[x]{???}` / `[x]{=y=}` — bracket + whitespace/invalid attr block | A whitespace-only block is a valid empty block → `<span>x</span>` (all impls); an invalid block is not an attribute block → the `]` and `{...}` stay literal, inner content still inline-parsed (`[*x*]{???}` → `[<strong>x</strong>]{???}`). carve-php stopped leaking the block (markup-carve/carve-php#43). Normative in grammar §14 and pinned across all three impls *(66-inline-span)*. The boundary of "yields an attribute" still diverges at the margins (carve-php-only: booleans, colon keys, comment-only blocks), so those are deliberately not pinned. |

### Intentional divergences (kept on purpose)

_None currently._

### Open (tracked)

Both found June 2026 while building the Markdown→Carve converters
(markup-carve/carve-js#62, markup-carve/carve-php#50). In both, **carve-js
matches the grammar and carve-php diverges**; canonical = carve-js.

| Input | Divergence | Canonical (grammar) | Proposed fix |
|-------|------------|---------------------|--------------|
| `` ```c++ ``, `` ```js title="x" `` — fence with a non-`[A-Za-z0-9_-]` info string | carve-js: not a valid fence → parsed as an inline code span. carve-php: accepts the whole trimmed info string as the language (`class="language-c++"`). | `language_info = (letter \| digit \| '-' \| '_')+` (`resources/grammar.ebnf:94`), optionally followed by `[attributes]`. A non-conforming info string is not a fence. So carve-js is correct. | 1. Restrict the carve-php fence opener to `language_info [attributes]`; reject anything else as a non-fence. 2. Then realign carve-php `MarkdownToCarve` to normalize an extended Markdown info string to its first token (the carve-js converter already does this). 3. Pin a corpus pair (e.g. `` ```c++ `` body → inline code). |
| `> quoted`<br>`continued` — a non-`>` line after a blockquote line | carve-js: blockquote ends at the non-`>` line → separate `<p>continued</p>`. carve-php: folds `continued` into the quote (CommonMark-style lazy continuation). | `blockquote = blockquote_line+`, `blockquote_line = '>', [' '], inline_content` (`resources/grammar.ebnf:98-99`) — every quoted line must begin with `>`; there is no lazy continuation. So carve-js is correct. | 1. Make the carve-php blockquote parser end the quote at the first non-`>` line. 2. Markdown's lazy continuation then stays a documented converter limitation in both `MarkdownToCarve` impls (it cannot be expressed in Carve); no separating blank is needed since both impls split. 3. Pin a corpus pair. |

When fixed, move each to *Resolved* and pin the corpus pair in `docs/examples.md`.

When a new divergence is found, verify it on both impls, decide the canonical,
and either pin it as a `docs/examples.md` pair (and move it to *Resolved*) or
record it as *Intentional* with the reason, or under *Open (tracked)* if it is
an implementation bug still being worked through.
